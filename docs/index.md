This tool becomes even more powerful when you combine it with existing tools.
In particular this library was designed to work well with:

- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) for general encoding tools and pipelines
- [whatlies](https://rasahq.github.io/whatlies/api/language/bpemb_lang/) for encoding tools on text data
- [dirty_cat](https://dirty-cat.github.io/stable/) for encoding tools on dirty categorical data
